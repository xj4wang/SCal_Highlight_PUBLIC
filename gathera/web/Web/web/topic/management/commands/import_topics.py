            Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese treatment which is applied by inserting
            thin needles in certain locations of body, has been used as a treatment for
            epilepsy. There are reports that it reduces the regularity and severity of
            epileptic episodes (seizures). A relevant document should discuss whether
            acupuncture can be used to treat epilepsy or control seizures and epilepsy
            symptoms.
